# Chat Components [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weolopez/ChatComponent.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/weolopez/ChatComponent.svg)

AngularJS and AngularFire Components 

Included out of the box you have a fully working green CI build using:

 * Karma - unit testing in real browsers
 * Gulp - JS task runner which:
     * Minification and concatenation of JS
     * Lints your JS code with JSHint
     * Runs tests through Karma
 * Travis CI - automated CI builds that run your tests on every commit.

Builds WILL be broken with bad tests and/or bad code (as per JSHint rules).

This project was initially forked from the application template seed here
[https://github.com/angular/angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-component-seed repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the angular-component-seed repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-component-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone angular-component-seed

Clone the angular-component-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/refactorthis/angular-component-seed.git
cd angular-component-seed
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

## Running Unit Tests

The angular-component-seed comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in
[Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with the [Karma Test Runner][karma]. We provide a Karma
configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and are named as `..._test.js`.

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to run:

```
gulp test
```

This task will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and
watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit.  This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected.  The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
gulp ci
```

## Updating Angular

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can update the Angular dependencies by running:

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.


## Continuous Integration

### Travis CI

[Travis CI][travis] is a continuous integration service, which can monitor GitHub for new commits
to your repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests. The angular-component-seed
project contains a Travis configuration file, `.travis.yml`, which will cause Travis to run your
tests when you push to GitHub.

You will need to enable the integration between Travis and GitHub. See the Travis website for more
instruction on how to do this.
